# ITCS3156FinalProject

# Description
This code analyzes and predicts air pollutant concentrations using global air quality data.
This project uses data from multiple countries to analyze relationships between air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3) and environmental factors (temperature, humidity, wind speed). It implements several machine learning models to predict pollutant levels. The data was pulled from kaggle.com

# Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Dataset
The analysis requires global_air_quality_data_10000.csv which should be placed in the project root directory.

# Usage
Run the main analysis script:
python global_air_quality_analysis_structured.py
